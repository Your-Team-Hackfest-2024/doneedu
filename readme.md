## Project Overview

DoNeedU is a platform where users can contribute to donation events or donate in cash to support the cause. The collected funds will be used to provide essential items such as vitamins, supplements, and animal products (milk, meat, etc.) to combat stunting.

## How It Works

1. **Participate in Donation Events:** Join our organized donation events to contribute towards the cause.

2. **Cash Donations:** Users can also donate in cash, which will be converted into essential items for those in need.

3. **Educational System:** Our donation events include an educating system aimed at informing pregnant mothers about preventive measures to avoid stunting in their babies.
